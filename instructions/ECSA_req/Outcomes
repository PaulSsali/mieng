7.1 Overview of outcomes
The outcomes required for professional registration as outlined in the Competency Standard
and are summarised in Table 1 below. In addition to Table 1, applicants need to further refer
to the detailed competency indicators for each category as stipulated in the Competency
Standard for Registration.
The defined outcomes are combined into five groups as follows:
• Group A: Engineering problem solving
• Group B: Managing engineering activities
• Group C: Risk and impact mitigation
• Group D: Act ethically, exercise judgment and take responsibility
• Group E: Professional development.

Here is a comprehensive write-up explaining the 11 outcomes for professional engineering registration, drawing on the information in the sources:

The sources outline **eleven outcomes** that candidates must demonstrate competence in to be considered for professional registration. These outcomes are grouped into five categories and require demonstration at a specific level depending on the registration category (Professional Engineer, Professional Engineering Technologist, or Professional Engineering Technician). The level of problem-solving (for Outcomes 1 and 2) and the demands of the engineering activity (for Outcomes 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10) are defined by level descriptors. Competence is not just about satisfying a list of outcomes linearly, but about demonstrating **integrated performance** across these outcomes, as engineering tasks often require the application of multiple outcomes.

Here is a breakdown of each of the 11 outcomes:

**Group A: Knowledge-based engineering problem solving**

*   **Outcome 1: Define, investigate and analyse [level] engineering problems**. This outcome involves the ability to **identify and formulate the problem**, leading to a clear definition. It also requires the candidate to **collect, organise, and evaluate information**, including clarifying requirements and identifying interested and affected parties and their expectations. Furthermore, it entails the use of **conceptualisation, abstraction, and modelling**, as well as identifying and justifying assumptions, limitations, constraints, and premises. Analysis involves using both **mathematical and non-mathematical analytical methods** and evaluating the results with sound judgement, expressing an understanding of these results. For Professional Engineers, this outcome focuses on **complex engineering problems**. For Professional Engineering Technologists, it involves **broadly defined engineering problems**. For Professional Engineering Technicians, it concerns **well-defined engineering problems**. Examples of what *not* to state include broad statements like "I was involved in..." without specific details.
*   **Outcome 2: Design or develop solutions to [level] engineering problems**. This outcome focuses on the ability to **develop solutions** to the problems defined in Outcome 1. It includes **analysing the requirements** for the solution and drawing up detailed specifications. Candidates must be able to **synthesise a range of potential solutions or approaches**, consistent with the identified assumptions, premises, limitations, and constraints. This involves **evaluating potential approaches** against the requirements, including costs and wider impacts, and presenting reasoned justification for the selected option. Finally, it requires the candidate to **fully develop the selected or preferred solution**. For Professional Engineers, this pertains to **complex engineering problems**. For Professional Engineering Technologists, it relates to **broadly defined engineering problems**. For Professional Engineering Technicians, it addresses **well-defined engineering problems**.
*   **Outcome 3: Comprehend and apply [level] knowledge: principles, specialist knowledge, jurisdictional and local knowledge**. This outcome involves understanding and using relevant knowledge in engineering practice. This includes **principles underpinning good practice, specialist knowledge, jurisdictional knowledge (legal and regulatory), and locally relevant codes of practice**. The required level of knowledge varies by registration category: **advanced and local knowledge** for Professional Engineers, knowledge embodied in **widely accepted and applied engineering procedures, processes, systems or methodologies and those specific to the jurisdiction** for Professional Engineering Technologists, and knowledge embodied in **established engineering practices that is specific to the jurisdiction** for Professional Engineering Technicians. Broad statements like "Following regulations and standards" or "Conversions between different units..." are insufficient; actual facts and application of knowledge must be demonstrated. This outcome underpins and supports the other outcomes.

**Group B: Manage Engineering Activities**

*   **Outcome 4: Manage part or all of one or more [level] engineering activities**. This outcome requires demonstrating **technical leadership and effective interpersonal skills**. It involves managing projects or tasks, including **planning activities, organising resources, leading teams, and controlling work**. It also includes **managing self, work priorities, work processes, and resources**, and working effectively in a team environment. The level of engineering activities also varies by category: **complex engineering activities** for Professional Engineers, **broadly defined engineering activities** for Professional Engineering Technologists, and **well-defined engineering activities** for Professional Engineering Technicians. Managing means getting the job done through other people.
*   **Outcome 5: Communicate clearly with others in the course of his or her engineering activities**. This outcome focuses on the ability to **communicate effectively** using various mediums with a broad range of stakeholders. This includes **writing clear, concise, and effective reports** that are technically, legally, and editorially correct. It also involves **issuing clear instructions**, ensuring correct interpretation and overcoming communication barriers. Furthermore, it includes the ability to **make oral presentations** using appropriate structure, style, language, visual aids, and supporting documents tailored to the audience and purpose. This outcome is assessed through written applications and during the professional review.

**Group C: Impacts of Engineering Activity**

*   **Outcome 6: Recognise and address the reasonably foreseeable social, cultural and environmental effects of [level] engineering activities**. This outcome requires understanding and addressing the broader impacts of engineering work. It involves the ability to **identify interested and affected parties and their expectations** regarding social, cultural, and environmental considerations. It also entails **recognising direct, indirect, immediate, and long-term effects** of engineering solutions and having due regard for the principles of **sustainability**. Candidates must be able to **propose measures to mitigate negative effects** and communicate with stakeholders. The level of engineering activities varies: **complex engineering activities seeking to achieve sustainability** for Professional Engineers, **broadly defined engineering activities seeking to achieve sustainability** for Professional Engineering Technologists, and **well-defined engineering activities seeking to achieve sustainability** for Professional Engineering Technicians.
*   **Outcome 7: Meet all legal and regulatory requirements and protect the health and safety of persons in the course of his or her [level] engineering activities**. This outcome focuses on the obligation to comply with relevant regulations and ensure safety. It requires the candidate to **identify applicable legal, regulatory, and health and safety requirements** for the engineering activity. This includes recognising that the **protection of society is the highest priority**. It also involves the ability to **select safe and sustainable materials, components, and systems**, seeking advice when necessary, and to **apply defined methods for risk identification and management**. The level of engineering activities varies: **all engineering activities** for all professional categories.

**Group D: Exercise judgement, take responsibility and act ethically**

*   **Outcome 8: Conduct engineering activities ethically**. This outcome requires demonstrating ethical behaviour no less than that defined by the Code of Conduct. Candidates must confirm they are **conversant and operate in compliance with the ECSA Rules of Conduct**. It involves the ability to **identify ethical problems and affected parties**, and to select the best solution to resolve the problem using a systematic approach. This outcome reflects the professional behaviour and attitudes expected of engineering professionals.
*   **Outcome 9: Exercise sound judgement in the course of [level] engineering activities**. This outcome focuses on the ability to make informed decisions with consideration of various factors. Judgement in decision-making involves considering the interrelationships of technologies and other disciplines, as well as the risks in technology application and the consequences for affected parties. Candidates must be able to **evaluate outcomes, impacts, and alternatives**. The level of engineering activities varies: **complex engineering activities** for Professional Engineers, **broadly defined engineering activities** for Professional Engineering Technologists, and **well-defined engineering activities** for Professional Engineering Technicians.
*   **Outcome 10: Be responsible for making decisions on part or all of [level] engineering activities**. This outcome requires demonstrating accountability for engineering decisions. Responsibility is exercised for the outcomes of significant parts of one or more engineering activities. Candidates must show they took engineering, social, environmental, and sustainable development considerations into account. They should also demonstrate when they sought advice from a responsible authority on matters outside their competence. The level of engineering activities varies: **complex engineering activities** for Professional Engineers, **broadly defined engineering activities** for Professional Engineering Technologists, and **well-defined engineering activities** for Professional Engineering Technicians. This item is about being solely responsible for the decision(s) taken, unlike Outcome 4 which involves managing through others.

**Group E: Continuing Professional Development**

*   **Outcome 11: Undertake sufficient professional development activities to maintain and extend competence**. This outcome requires demonstrating a commitment to lifelong learning. Professional development involves maintaining and extending competence, as well as enhancing the ability to adapt to emerging technologies and the changing nature of work. Candidates need to state their strategy for professional development and demonstrate independent learning ability. Examples of professional development activities include taking courses, attending workshops and conferences, writing technical papers, reading technical articles, and conducting research. This outcome underpins all other outcomes.

The demonstration of these 11 outcomes is crucial for professional registration and is assessed through various forms of evidence, including Training and Experience Reports, Engineering Reports, and Referee Reports, as well as through the Professional Review process.
