Here is a list of the 11 outcomes for professional engineering registration, as described in the sources and our conversation history:

*   **Outcome 1:** Define, investigate and analyse \*[level]\* engineering problems.
*   **Outcome 2:** Design or develop solutions to \*[level]\* engineering problems.
*   **Outcome 3:** Comprehend and apply [level] knowledge: principles, specialist knowledge, jurisdictional and local knowledge.
*   **Outcome 4:** Manage part or all of one or more \*[level]\* engineering activities.
*   **Outcome 5:** Communicate clearly with others in the course of his or her engineering activities.
*   **Outcome 6:** Recognise and address the reasonably foreseeable social, cultural and environmental effects of \*[level]\* engineering activities.
*   **Outcome 7:** Meet all legal and regulatory requirements and protect the health and safety of persons in the course of his or her \*[level]\* engineering activities.
*   **Outcome 8:** Conduct engineering activities ethically.
*   **Outcome 9:** Exercise sound judgement in the course of \*[level]\* engineering activities.
*   **Outcome 10:** Be responsible for making decisions on part or all of \*[level]\* engineering activities.
*   **Outcome 11:** Undertake professional development activities sufficient to maintain and extend his or her competence.

As noted in our previous turn, the \`[level]\` descriptor differentiates the standards for Professional Engineer, Professional Engineering Technologist, and Professional Engineering Technician. For a Professional Engineer, Outcomes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10 relate to **complex** engineering problems or activities. For a Professional Engineering Technologist, these outcomes relate to **broadly defined** engineering problems or activities. For a Professional Engineering Technician, these outcomes relate to **well-defined** engineering problems or activities.
