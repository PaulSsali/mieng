# Profile Page Code Review & Detailed Requirements

Based on my review of the provided ProfilePage code, I'll outline detailed requirements and UI specifications for this page.

## Overview

The profile page appears to be part of an engineering professional development platform, specifically focused on ECSA (Engineering Council of South Africa) registration. The page allows users to view and edit their professional information while tracking their registration progress.

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Profile Display**
   - Display user's personal and professional information
   - Show registration status and progress
   - Present ECSA outcomes completion metrics
   - Display membership information

2. **Profile Editing**
   - Toggle between view and edit modes
   - Edit personal information including:
     - Full name
     - Professional title
     - Company/Organization
     - Location
     - Professional bio
   - Upload/change profile picture

3. **Registration Progress Tracking**
   - Display progress on ECSA outcomes (9/11 completed)
   - Show professional experience accumulation (3.2 years)
   - Display CPD (Continuing Professional Development) points (25/25)
   - List missing outcomes
   - Show next steps with deadlines

4. **Navigation**
   - Link to Account Settings
   - Link to Dashboard

### UI Specifications

#### Layout Structure
1. **Header Section**
   - MainHeader component at the top
   - Full-width background image (profile-background.png)
   - Profile picture overlay with edit capability 
   - "My Profile" title with Edit/Save buttons

2. **Main Content Area** - 3-column grid layout
   - Left sidebar (1 column): User summary card
   - Right content (2 columns): Professional information card
   - Full-width card below: ECSA Registration Progress

#### User Summary Card
- Profile image (128x128px)
- Full name and professional title
- Registration status badge ("In Progress" - amber colored)
- Membership type badge ("Pro Plan" - primary color with transparency)
- Member since information
- Account Settings button (full width)

#### Professional Information Card
- View mode: Displays company, location, and professional bio
- Edit mode: Form fields for full name, professional title, company, location, and bio
- Clearly separated sections with headings

#### ECSA Registration Progress Card
- 3-column metrics display showing:
  - ECSA Outcomes progress (9/11)
  - Professional experience (3.2 years)
  - CPD Points (25/25)
- Missing Outcomes section with amber badges
- Next Steps section with status icons (CheckCircle for completed, Clock for pending)
- Dashboard link button

#### Visual Design Elements
- Consistent color scheme using primary colors and muted variants
- Status badges with appropriate colors (amber for "In Progress", primary for "Pro Plan")
- Icons for visual indicators (Camera, Award, Calendar, Clock, CheckCircle, Edit, Save)
- Rounded profile images (border-radius: full)
- Card-based layout with consistent padding and spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy with headings, subheadings, and body text
- Responsive design adapting to different screen sizes

#### Responsive Behavior
- Single column layout on mobile devices
- Three-column grid on medium and larger screens
- Appropriate spacing and padding adjustments

#### State Management
- Toggle between view and edit modes
- Form validation for edited fields (not fully implemented in current code)
- Optimistic UI updates while saving

## Technical Considerations

1. **Missing Implementation Details**
   - Form validation logic
   - API integration for saving profile data
   - Image upload functionality
   - Data fetching for initial profile state

2. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Add ARIA attributes for better screen reader support
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast for text elements
   - Add keyboard navigation support for form elements
   - Include proper focus management when toggling edit mode

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize image loading with proper sizing and formats
   - Consider lazy loading for profile images
   - Implement efficient state management for form fields

These requirements and specifications provide a comprehensive blueprint for implementing and refining the Profile Page in the engineering professional development platform.
